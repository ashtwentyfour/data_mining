k - means clustering algorithm
=====================

This package can be used to cluster data using the k - means algorithm
---------------------


**STEPS FOR USE**

- create an object of class K_Means: K_Means k = new K_Means()
- invoke the function 'cluster_by_k_means' on the object and pass the input file of tuples, the value of k (number of clusters), and the number of iterations
- the tuples along with the cluster (center) they belong to will be printed
- example in Driver.java 

**TO BUILD DOCKER IMAGE**

- run 'docker build .' and run 'docker run <Image ID>'

**TO RUN USING DOCKER COMPOSE**

- run 'docker-compose up'
